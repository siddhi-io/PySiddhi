It is important to keep \nfollowing points in mind when using PySiddhi API.\n\n\n\n\nIt is a wrapper. Not a port.\n - Whenever you use the PySiddhi API, the \nSiddhi Java Library\n is loaded in background using Java Virtual Machine.\n\n\nThe wrapper is focused on functionality provided by \nsiddhi-core\n which is found in package \norg.wso2.siddhi.core\n. The future versions of API may have the ability to load Siddhi Extensions directly from Java Packages and use them in Siddhi Queries. However, the individual Java classes of extensions will not be wrapped. \n\n\nOnly the classes that are required for API users are wrapped.\n  Classes which are designed to be used by Siddhi Java Library for its internal work will not be wrapped. \n\n\nPython doesn't differentiate \nInteger\n from \nLong\n. But Siddhi do.\n Python 3 does not differentiate \nInteger\n and \nLong\n Data Types. All Python \nIntegers\n fed into Siddhi (via \nInputHandler\n) are converted into Java \nIntegers\n. To feed Java \nLong\n to Siddhi (via \nInputHandler\n), use \nDataTypes.LongType\n. All \nLong\n outputs received from Siddhi (via callbacks) will also be converted to \nDataTypes.LongType\n.\n\n\nExample: \ninputHandler.send([\"IBM\",700.0,LongType(100)])\n\n\nClean up everything when you are done.\n Remember to call \nshutdown\n of \nSiddhiManager\n and \nSiddhiAppRuntime\n.\n\n\n\n\nJava Siddhi to PySiddhi Mappings\n\n\nThe PySiddhi wrapper is focused on functionality provided by \nsiddhi-core\n. \nThe classes in Java package \norg.wso2.siddhi.core\n are mapped to \nPySiddhi4.core\n using hand written logic.

            "text": "The PySiddhi API is a wrapper on Siddhi Java Library, exposing it's core features to Python. It is important to keep \nfollowing points in mind when using PySiddhi API.   It is a wrapper. Not a port.  - Whenever you use the PySiddhi API, the  Siddhi Java Library  is loaded in background using Java Virtual Machine.  The wrapper is focused on functionality provided by  siddhi-core  which is found in package  org.wso2.siddhi.core . The future versions of API may have the ability to load Siddhi Extensions directly from Java Packages and use them in Siddhi Queries. However, the individual Java classes of extensions will not be wrapped.   Only the classes that are required for API users are wrapped.   Classes which are designed to be used by Siddhi Java Library for its internal work will not be wrapped.   Python doesn't differentiate  Integer  from  Long . But Siddhi do.  Python 3 does not differentiate  Integer  and  Long  Data Types. All Python  Integers  fed into Siddhi (via  InputHandler ) are converted into Java  Integers . To feed Java  Long  to Siddhi (via  InputHandler ), use  DataTypes.LongType . All  Long  outputs received from Siddhi (via callbacks) will also be converted to  DataTypes.LongType .  Example:  inputHandler.send([\"IBM\",700.0,LongType(100)])  Clean up everything when you are done.  Remember to call  shutdown  of  SiddhiManager  and  SiddhiAppRuntime .",
